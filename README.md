### Offering discounts or special promotions on products is a powerful strategy to attract customers. These offers create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, making people feel they are getting a better deal or saving money. Discounts tap into the psychological principle of scarcity, where limited-time offers or limited-quantity items drive people to make quicker purchasing decisions to avoid missing out. Additionally, promotions can help introduce new products to the market, encourage repeat purchases, and build customer loyalty. By reducing the price barrier, more customers are likely to try a product, leading to increased sales and brand awareness.
